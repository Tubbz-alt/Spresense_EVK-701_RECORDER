# Overview
Available in Arduino development environment.
Data logger for Sony's IoT computer SPRESENSE.
There is a function to write data such as inertia sensor and time stamp to the SD card.
The time is corrected with the GPS signal.

**Required devices**
* SPRESENSE+CXD5602PWBEXT1(https://developer.sony.com/ja/develop/spresense/)
* SPRESENSE-SENSOR-EVK-701(https://www.rohm.co.jp/support/spresense-add-on-board)

# Features
* A new file is created every 30 minutes.
* After creating a new file, correct the RTC time with the GPS signal before starting sensing.
* The sensing data is stored in the SD card slot of CXD5602PWBEXT1.
* Data logging will not start until the RTC time correction using the GPS signal is complete. An accurate record of the time remains.
* The recorded acceleration and pressure are 25 [Hz] intervals.
* The maximum acceleration to be acquired is Â± 4 [G] and the resolution is 1 [mG].
* The unit of air pressure to be acquired is [hPa].
* Does not drive interrupts.
